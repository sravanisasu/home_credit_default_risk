Here’s how **Domino** compares to the drawbacks you've listed for **Starbase**:

1. **Random Unresponsive UI**:
   - **Starbase**: Experiences issues with UI responsiveness, which can cause delays or unresponsiveness during long usage.
   - **Domino**: Generally offers a more stable and responsive UI with performance optimized for large-scale use cases. Domino is designed for seamless user interaction, even for large experiments.

2. **Manual Setup** (script additions for tables, model registrations):
   - **Starbase**: Requires manual additions of scripts for tasks like table and model registrations, which can be cumbersome and lead to overhead.
   - **Domino**: Provides more automation in model registration, versioning, and experiment tracking. You don’t need to manually add scripts for most of these tasks, reducing overhead.

3. **Deep Technical Understanding for Customization** (model monitoring metrics):
   - **Starbase**: Customizing model monitoring metrics requires deep technical expertise.
   - **Domino**: While Domino offers customization options, it also provides a user-friendly interface for monitoring and adjusting metrics. Advanced customization is possible, but the tool is designed to be accessible without requiring deep technical expertise.

4. **File Format Compatibility (CSV, Parquet)**:
   - **Starbase**: Cannot register data sources if the data is in file formats like CSV or Parquet, only supporting tables.
   - **Domino**: Supports a wide variety of data sources, including CSV, Parquet, and other file formats, making it more flexible in terms of data input.

### Summary:
Compared to **Starbase**, **Domino** does not have these specific drawbacks. Domino’s UI is generally more responsive, it provides better automation (reducing manual setup), and offers more flexibility with file formats (like CSV and Parquet). Additionally, Domino is designed to be accessible for customization without requiring deep technical knowledge.
